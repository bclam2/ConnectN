# Connect N

## What is Connect N?
Everyone is familiar with the classic board game, Connect 4. The gist of the game is that two players go head to head trying to fit four pieces of their color in a consecutive manner, whether it be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

Connect N is a spin off of this class game but unlike Connect 4, players have extra options to take the game up a notch. Connect N allows players to modify the size of the board to be 7 x 7, 8 x 8, or 9 x 9. They can also adjust the number of consecutive pieces required to win to 4, 5, or 6.
